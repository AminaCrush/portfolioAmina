          I won't prolong the introduction and will start by saying that I had
          to grow up quickly and begin working at a young age. Unfortunately or
          fortunately, I also matured earlier than my peers. I have worked in
          various fields and gained experience in sales, cosmetics, business,
          and multimedia. I have worked abroad and am an SMM specialist, mobile
          photographer, lash maker, and I also studied psychology for a while.
          Currently, I have three active businesses. I have been interested in
          sports since childhood: I am a former candidate for master of sports
          in boxing and have also practiced swimming, aikido, kickboxing, and
          athletics. At the moment, I am training in the gym and am a
          second-year student at Askar Salymbekov University. In conclusion, I
          can say that in my short life, I have learned a lot and gained
          experience in various areas. This helps me connect with people and
          easily integrate into a team. In the future, I will continue to grow
          and strive for more knowledge.
